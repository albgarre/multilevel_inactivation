# multilevel_inactivation

This repository includes the R code we used for the article **Multilevel modelling as a tool to include variability and uncertainty in quantitative microbiology and risk assessment. Thermal inactivation of Listeria monocytogenes as proof of concept**, published in Food Research International, 137, 109374 (doi: 10.1016/j.foodres.2020.109374).

That article illustrates the use of Bayesian statistics and multilevel modelling to describe variability at the population level for microbial inactivation.
